"""The Dot's engine: inbound events in, turns of the model out, outbound events into the outbox.

Everything the host sees is a row of `dots_outbox`, written by `DotStore` in the
transaction of the state change it describes. This module decides what work
runs, and what an outcome of a turn means; the turn itself is `TurnRunner`'s.

- `user.message` and `automation.fired` rows wait in `dots_inbound` until the
  chat turn takes them as its opening messages (or, while one runs, injects them
  into it). The transcript marks them in the transaction that stores their
  text, and the transaction that appends the answer applies them
  (`transcript_outbox.py`).
- `task.created` queues a task; tasks run one at a time, highest priority
  first, each in its own session. The answer that ends a task completes it in
  the transcript's transaction; a failed or empty run fails it here.
- `system.event task.cancelled` ends a queued or running task and cancels its turn.
- `approval.received` records the decision on the approval it names, in the
  transaction that accepts it. The work loop then tells the session that made
  the call, in a turn of its own: an approved call is to be made again with
  exactly its arguments (the gate lets that one through, once, `gate.py`), a
  rejected one did not run. Nothing waits in memory.
- An answer a chat owes (inputs in the transcript, none answered, no approval
  holding the session) is given by a turn with no opening message: one rule
  for a restart, a prepare-sleep and any turn that ended early.

- Once the Dot has been quiet for a while after a turn (and after a start), a memory pass brings MEMORY.md up
  to date from the conversations that changed (`memory_update.py`). It runs beside nothing: a turn that starts
  does not wait for it, and a pass waits for the next quiet spell when a turn runs.

One asyncio loop runs everything; the one SQLite connection is used on it only.
At most one chat turn and one task turn run at a time, and they may overlap.
